# Classes and Objects
A C++ class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information and behavior about an object.

# Access Specifiers
Access specifiers are C++ keywords that determine the scope of class components:

public: Class members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
private: Class members are only accessible from inside the class.
Encapsulation is achieved by declaring class attributes as private:

Accessor functions: return the value of private member variables.
Mutator functions: change the value of private member variables.

# Constructors
For a C++ class, a constructor is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor signature must be unique.

# Inheritance
In C++, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. In an inheritance relationship, there are two categories of classes:

Base class: The class being inherited from.
Derived class: The class that inherits from the base class.
It’s possible to have multi-level inheritance where classes are constructed in order from the “most base” class to the “most derived” class.

# Class Members
A class is comprised of class members:

Attributes, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
Methods, also known as member functions, are functions that can be used with an instance of the class.

# Constructor
For a C++ class, a constructor is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor signature must be unique.

# Objects
In C++, an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality pertaining to that data.

# Class
A C++ class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information and behavior about an object. It serves as a blueprint for future inherited classes.

# Access Control Operators
C++ classes have access control operators that designate the scope of class members:

 - public
 - private
public members are accessible everywhere; private members can only be accessed from within the same instance of the class or from friends classes.
